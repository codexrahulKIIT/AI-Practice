# 🤖 Mastering AI with Python
# 🧠 🛠️ Building AI from Scratch with Python
# 📘 AI Learning Journey with Python


Welcome to my **AI Practice** repository! This project is created to help me learn and implement various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms using **Python**.

## 📌 Objective

To practice core AI concepts and build a strong foundation by implementing popular algorithms, solving problems, and building small projects.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Search Algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)
- ✅ Minimax Algorithm (with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning)
- ✅ Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
- ✅ Logic and Inference
- ✅ Machine Learning Basics (Linear Regression, KNN, etc.)
- ✅ Neural Networks (basic implementation)
- ✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP basics)

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
nltk
